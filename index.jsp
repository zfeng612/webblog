        <p>Welcome to my home page. There's not much on this site right now. More information will be added to each page as the semester progresses.</p>
        <p>This website will be a news source/blog for all your  entertainment needs. The articles on this website will mostly be posts about video games, music, and films. </p>
        <p>Registered users can create posts about anything they want. It can be a user log of a game, release date of a new upcoming film, review of an album or song, or any other type of general information about a certain product.</p>
